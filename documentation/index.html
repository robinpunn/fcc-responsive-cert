            <h3>What is defi?</h3>
            <p>Defi is short for decentralized finance. The ethereum blockchain houses code that powers dApps (decentralized applications). These dApps have various functionality based on their code. Users of dApps access decentralized services on the blockchain in a permissionless manner.</p>
            <p>Types of dApps include:</p>
            <ul class="defi-ul">
                <li>decentralized exchanges</li>
                <li>lending protocols</li>
                <li>yield aggregators</li>
                <li>marketplaces</li>

          <h3>What is MakerDAO?</h3>
          <p>MakerDAO is a lending and borrowing protocol.</p>
          <p>By depositing ethereum, users are able to borrow <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai">$DAI</a>.  DAI is a stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar.  With borrowed DAI, users are able to use it the same way fiat currency would be used.</p>
          <p>Users have to keep track of ethereum price as a level of collateral must be maintained.  If the price of ethereum falls too far, part of the ethereum collateral will be liquidated unless the DAI loan is repaid.</p>
          <code>deposit eth => borrow dai => maintain collateral</code>
          <p>Users can also acquire the Maker token.  The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/maker">$MKR</a> token gives holders governance rights allowing for votes on proposals involving the protocol.</p>

          <h3>What is Curve?</h3>
          <p>Curve finance is a stable swap and liquidity pool dApp.</p>
          <p>Users are able to swap between stable coins, bitcoin, ethereum, and some select cryptocurrencies.  Users can also pool select tokens into liquidty pools to earn rewards.  Rewards are given in curve tokens or pooled tokens.  Users can use Curve tokens to vote on protocol proposals.  Curve tokens are locked for a certain period of time increasing the amount of voting power.</p>
          <ul class="defi-ul">
            <li>swap between stable coins</li>  
            <li>desposit coins into liquidty pools</li>

          <p>Aave is a lending and borrowing protocol.</p>

            <li>deposit stablecoins or other tokens</li>
            <li>borrow stablecoins or other tokens</li>

          <h3>What is Uniswap?</h3>
          <p>Uniswap is a decentralized exchange(DEX). Users can swap cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies.  Users can particpate in liquidity pools.  By participating in liquidity pools, users are rewarded with fees based on the percentage of their supply in the pool.  Users can also hold and stake the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uniswap">$UNI</a> token which distributes rewards from transactions fees occuring on the Uniswap exchange. </p>
          <code>swap a veriety of tokens
            supply liquidity => earn fees from transactions
            stake $UNI governance token => receive rewards from transactions on the exchange

          <h3>What is Convex?</h3>
          <p>Convex is a platform that builds ontop of Curve finance.  Users are able to deposit CRV tokens and earn boosted rewards.  Users also receive other tokens based on how voting plays out. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/convex-finance">$CVX</a> tokens can be staked to receive extra rewards.</p>
          <code>deposit crv => receive cvxCRV => stake cvxCRV => receive CRV rewards => earn crv trading fees
            lock cvx => earn platform fees
          </code>
          <p>Convex shows the true potential of defi.  It was a protocol created to take advantage of a protocol that was already in place.</p>
